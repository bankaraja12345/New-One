                        We come across all kinds of documents
every day of our lives. Newspapers,
insurance forms, shop catalogues... the
list goes on. <br>
<br>
Many web pages act like electronic versions of these
documents. For example, newspapers show the same stories
in print as they do on websites; you can apply for insurance
over the web; and stores have online catalogs and e-commerce
facilities. <br>
<br>
In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey
and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how
to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to
structure documents. In this chapter you will: <br>
<br>
● See how HTML describes the structure of a web page <br>
<br>
● Learn how tags or elements are added to your document <br>
<br>
● Write your first web page

                    <h3 class="notes-heading">How Pages Use
                        Structure</h3>
                        <h3>Think about the stories you
                            read in a newspaper: for each
                            story, there will be a headline,
                            some text, and possibly some
                            images. If the article is a long
                            piece, there may be subheadings
                            that split the story into separate
                            sections or quotes from those
                            involved. Structure helps readers
                            understand the stories in the
                            newspaper. <br>
                            <br>
                            The structure is very similar
                            when a news story is viewed
                            online (although it may also
                            feature audio or video). This is
                            illustrated on the right with a
                            copy of a newspaper alongside
                            the corresponding article on its
                            website. <br>
                            <br>
                            Now think about a very different
                            type of document — an
                            insurance form. Insurance forms
                            often have headings for different
                            sections, and each section
                            contains a list of questions with
                            areas for you to fill in details or
                            checkboxes to tick. Again, the
                            structure is very similar online.</h3>

                                <h3>The use of headings and
                                    subheadings in any document
                                    often reflects a hierarchy of
                                    information. For example, a
                                    document might start with
                                    a large heading, followed by
                                    an introduction or the most
                                    important information. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This might be expanded upon
                                    under subheadings lower down
                                    on the page. When using a word
                                    processor to create a document,
                                    we separate out the text to give
                                    it structure. Each topic might
                                    have a new paragraph, and each
                                    section can have a heading to
                                    describe what it covers. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    On the right, you can see a
                                    simple document in Microsoft
                                    Word. The different styles for
                                    the document, such as different
                                    levels of heading, are shown
                                    in the drop down box. If you
                                    regularly use Word, you might
                                    have also used the formatting
                                    toolbar or palette to do this.</h3>

                                        a Word document to make it
                                        easier to understand. We use
                                        structure in the same way when
                                        writing web pages.</h3>

                                                describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want

                                                    made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
                                                    has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser
